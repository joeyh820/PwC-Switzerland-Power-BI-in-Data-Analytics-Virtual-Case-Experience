## Introduction
This repository showcases work from the PwC Switzerland PowerBI Virtual Case Experience by Forage, highlighting my submissions (.pbix files and insights) for the Digital Accelerator team simulation. Data files were provided by PwC Switzerland.

## Scenario
The program, aimed at upskilling PwC employees to become "Digital Accelerators," involves three tasks:
1. **Call Centre Dashboard**: Visualize customer and agent behavior.
2. **Customer Retention**: Analyze and predict churn using customer demographics.
3. **Diversity & Inclusion**: Visualize gender balance in the executive suite.

## Technical Stack
- **Visualization**: Microsoft PowerBI, PowerPoint for layout design.
